# Algorithm-Assignment2

**1. You need to implement the polygon triangulation problem.**

(a) Prepare a dataset for the convex polygon with (increasing) number of arbitrary vertices. 

(b) Consider a brute force method where you do an exhaustive search for finding the optimal result. 

(c)  Next apply dynamic programming, in line with the matrix chain multiplication problem.

(d) Then implement a greedy strategy to solve the same problem by choosing non-intersecting diagonals in sorted order.

(e)  Finally compare the results and suggest whether the DP and Greedy approach results show mismatch.


**2. Implement data compression strategies:**

(a) Write encoding algorithms for the Shannon-Fano coding scheme.

(b) Implement Huffman encoding scheme using heap as data structure.

(c) Implement an instantaneous decoding algorithm.

(d) Choose a large text document and get results of Huffman coding with this document.

(e) Examine the optimality of Huffman codes as data compression strategy by comparing with another document.
